Yet Another Template Library

1. YATL a.k.a. Yet Another Template Library, is a (not yet) comprehensive template library with the following goals in mind:

2. Provide a data-centric approach to programming. Separate the constant data from the functionality by letting the compiler take care of transforming the data to an efficiently usable form

3. Run-time Performance

4. Ease of use


Some of the features provided by YATL:

1. Powerful compile-time data manipulation meta functions and structures

2. Fuzzy-logic based control flow in C++

3. Concurrent lock-based and lock-free data structures

4. Concurrent performance measurement framework

5. Unit Test framework (similar to JUnit)
